### Wish someone special happy birthday in a special way.

#### [See it Live](https://bedbug2479.github.io/happy-birthday/)

#### Update: Now you can customize all the texts without modifying the code!

On the birthday of a special friend, I felt like the generic happy birthday text just wasn't gonna cut it for me. So I put together this animated web page at the last minute to wish them Happy Birthday.

* Fork the repository
* Open `customize.json` and replace the content with your own
* Turn on GitHub pages for your repository (Settings > Pages)
* Share the URL you get at the above step with your friend

**You do not need to create Pull Request to this main repository to get it running.**

## Contributing

I've used plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript with [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap) for animations.
If you have any idea to improve it or make it more interesting, feel free to send a PR, or create an issue for a feature request.

Happy wishing! ðŸŽ‰
